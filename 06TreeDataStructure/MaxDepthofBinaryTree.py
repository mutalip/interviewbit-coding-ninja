# Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

# The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

#  NOTE : The path has to end on a leaf node. 
# Example :

#          1
#         /
#        2
# max depth = 2.


# Definition for a  binary tree node
# class TreeNode:
#    def __init__(self, x):
#        self.val = x
#        self.left = None
#        self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    # @param A : root node of tree
    # @return an integer
    def maxDepth(self, A):
        if A is None:
            return 0
        return max(self.maxDepth(A.left), self.maxDepth(A.right)) + 1
