# A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

# 'A' -> 1
# 'B' -> 2
# ...
# 'Z' -> 26
# Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.



# Input Format:

# The first and the only argument is a string A.
# Output Format:

# Return an integer, representing the number of ways to decode the string.
# Constraints:

# 1 <= length(A) <= 1e5
# Example :

# Input 1:
#     A = "8"

# Output 1:
#     1

# Explanation 1:
#     Given encoded message "8", it could be decoded as only "H" (8).

#     The number of ways decoding "8" is 1.

# Input 2:
#     A = "12"

# Output 2:
#     2

# Explanation 2:
#     Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1, 2) or "L" (12).
    
#     The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
