# Unique Paths in a Grid
# Asked in:  
# Facebook
# Given a grid of size m * n, lets assume you are starting at (1,1) and your goal is to reach (m,n). At any instance, if you are on (x,y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).

# Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
# An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

# Example :
# There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

# [
#   [0,0,0],
#   [0,1,0],
#   [0,0,0]
# ]
# The total number of unique paths is 2.

#  Note: m and n will be at most 100.
